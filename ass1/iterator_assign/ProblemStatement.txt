INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------

You are to write a program that implements an iterator for a binary
search tree.  Specifically you should be able to write the following
main program.

int main(){
  Node* s=NULL;  
  insert(s, 10); 
  insert(s, 5);
  insert(s, 15);
  insert(s, 14);
  insert(s, 16);

  for(Node::iterator it = s->begin(); it != s->end(); ++it){
    cout << *it <<' ';
  }
  cout << endl;
}

This should print 5 10 14 15 16, i.e. the values in s in ascending
order.  This is given just as an example; below you will be given the
actual main program that you are required to include in your submission.

------------------------------------------------------------
SOME HELP AND ALSO SOME PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION SNIPPETS
------------------------------------------------------------

An iterator is to be thought of as an abstract pointer, and it
overloads the operators unary ++, unary *, and the binary !=.  The *
operator should return the value pointed to by the abstract pointer.
The ++ operator should cause the abstract pointer to point
(abstractly!) to the next object in the set.

You should start with the search tree code that you have developed so
far.  You may want to include print function we wrote earlier for the
purposes of debugging.  The iterator will have to be another struct.
Since the Node struct and the iterator struct refer to each other, you
will have to declare them in the following manner.

struct Node;

struct bstIt{
  vector<Node*> anc;  //pointers to ancestors from tree root to self.
  void operator++();  // prefix unary operator
  int operator*();    // prefix unary operator
  bool operator !=(const bstIt);  // binary operator
};

struct Node{
  Node *left, *right;
  int value;
  Node(int v){value = v; left=right=NULL;}
  typedef bstIt iterator;
  bstIt begin();
  bstIt end();
};

Notice that the way this has been written everything is referenced
only after it is declared.  Note further that the type bstIt is
defined as iterator; this allows us to write Node::iterator and mean
bstIt to mimic the standard library.

The iterator could be implemented as a real pointer to the node
containing the next element of the set that should be returned when
the user dereferences the iterator.  However, going to the next element is
tricky.  This may require moving up/down the tree.  For example, if the
current node is a left child, and it has no right child, then the next
value will be found in the parent of the current node.  However, our
Node object does not hold a parent pointer.  That is why the iterator
object holds the complete list of ancestors including the current Node.
Using the ancestor list, you can go to the parent or the grandparent of the
node as you wish.  When you want the current value, you simply
dereference the last of those ancestors

The abstract dereferencing operator on iterators must simply
dereference the last of the ancestors and return the value stored in
it.  Thus its implementation is:

int bstIt::operator*(){
  return anc.back()->value;
}

To get started, first answer the following questions as clearly as
possible.  (1) Which node holds the value of the smallest element in
the set?  How do you get to it, i.e. what is the sequence of nodes to
it from the root (these are its ancestors which you want stored in the
iterator object).  This is what the begin member function in Node will
have to return.  (2) Given a current node, how do you get to the node
containing the next largest element in the set?  Although we dont have
parent pointers, we do have the vector of ancestors, which will enable
you to move up to the parents if you wish.  But note that the ancestor
information should change when the iterator is incremented using the
++ operator.

-----

Note that we are using structs rather than classes so that we can
freely use all members of all structs.  Ideally, you should use
classes and not expose everything.  For this the notion of friends is
useful, which is discussed in the book but which you dont need to know
for the purpose of this lab.

WHAT YOU ARE TO SUBMIT
------------------------------------------------------------

You are to submit a single source code file containing the following
main program and declarations of Node and bstIt given above, repeated
for convenience.  At the beginning of the file you should put other
code as might be necessary to execute the main program: specifically,
the definitions of the relevant functions.

//----------file begins------------------

struct Node;

struct bstIt{
  vector<Node*> anc;  //pointers to ancestors from tree root to self.
  void operator++();  // prefix unary operator
  int operator*();    // prefix unary operator
  bool operator !=(const bstIt);  // binary operator
};

struct Node{
  Node *left, *right;
  int value;
  Node(int v){value = v; left=right=NULL;}
  typedef bstIt iterator;
  bstIt begin();
  bstIt end();
};


int main(){
  Node* s = NULL;
  while(true){
    char input;
    cin>>input;
    if(input=='x')
      break;
    else if(input=='i'){
      int value;
      cin>>value;
      insert(s, value);
    }
    else if(input=='p'){
      if(s==NULL){
        cout<<-1<<endl;
      }
      else {
        for(Node::iterator it = s->begin(); it !=s->end(); ++it){
          cout << *it <<' ';
        }
        cout << endl;
      }
    }
  }
}

//----------- file ends-------

Copy the code given above, and to it add whatever is needed to make it
execute.

Here is a quick description of the main program.  It takes input using
letters for functions: ‘i’ for insert, ‘p’ for print using iterator,
and ‘x’ for exit.  For example, "i 10" will insert 10 into the binary
search tree. "p" will print the values of the tree in the
increasing-order, and -1 if the tree is empty, "x" will exit the
program.  A sample input and corresponding output is given below.

Sample input:
p
i 15
i 2
p
i 10
i 20
p
i 3
p
x

Sample output:
-1
2 15
2 10 15 20
2 3 10 15 20

EXPLANATION: Initially the binary search tree is empty, hence output
corresponding to 'p' is -1. 'i 15' and 'i 2' should insert 15 and 2
into the tree. Now 'p' should print elements in the tree in increasing
order, i.e., 2 15. Similarly for the other insert and print
operations. Finally 'x' will terminate the program.
