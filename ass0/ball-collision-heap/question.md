#Assignment 2
Suppose you have n balls of unit mass and radius positioned on a straight line at specified positions. They are free to move along the line and their initial velocities are also given. Assume there is no friction and that collisions are elastic, i.e. when balls collide their velocities just get exchanged. As you can see, there will be some number of collisions after which the balls will simply escape to infinity on either side of the line. You are to write a program which takes the initial positions and velocities and prints the position and velocities of the balls at the time just after the last collision. Your code should include a binary heap -- it will help in speeding up execution.
